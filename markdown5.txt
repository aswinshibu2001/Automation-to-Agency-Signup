## LangChain FAQs
Is LangChain still useful if I’m only using one model or vector database provider?
Yes - LangChain is valuable even if you’re using one provider. Its LangChain Expression Language standardizes methods such as parallelization, fallbacks, and async for more durable execution. We also provide observability out of the box with LangSmith, making the process of getting to production more seamless.
Is LangChain open source?
Yes - LangChain is an MIT-licensed open-source library and is free to use.
What are the most common ways people use LangChain?
LangChain is often used for chaining together a series of LLM calls or for retrieval augmented generation. We recommend you try out [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) if you want to build an agent.
Can I use LangChain in production?
Yes, LangChain 0.1 and later are production-ready. We've streamlined the package, which has fewer dependencies for better compatibility with the rest of your code base. We're also committed to no breaking changes on any minor version of LangChain after 0.1, so you can upgrade your patch versions (e.g., 0.2.x) on any minor version without impact.
Is LangChain suitable for the enterprise?
Yes, LangChain is widely used by Fortune 2000 companies. Many enterprises use LangChain to future-proof their stack, allowing for the easy integration of additional model providers as their needs evolve. Visit our to see how companies are using LangChain.
How is LangChain different from LangGraph?
For straight-forward chains and retrieval flows, start building with LangChain using LangChain Expression Language to piece together components. If you’re building agents or need complex orchestration, use [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) instead.
